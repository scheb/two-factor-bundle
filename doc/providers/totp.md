TOTP Authentication
====================

## How it works

This authenticator is similar and compatible with [Google Authenticator](google.md). The configuration process is
identical: a secret code and parameters are associated to the user. Users can add that code to the application on their
mobile. The app will generate a numeric code from it that changes after a period of time.

The main difference is that several parameters can be customized:

* The number of digits (default = 6),
* The digest (default = sha1),
* The period (default = 30 seconds),
* Custom parameters can be added.


## Basic Configuration

To enable this authentication method add this to your configuration:

```yaml
scheb_two_factor:
    totp:
        enabled: true
```

Your user entity has to implement `Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Model\Totp\TwoFactorInterface`. To activate this method for a
user, generate a secret and define the TOTP configuration. TOTP let's you configure the number of digits, the algorithm
and the period of the temporary codes.

We warned, custom configurations will not be compatible with the defaults of Google Authenticator app any more. You will
have to use another application (e.g. FreeOTP on Android).

```php
namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Model\Totp\TotpConfiguration;
use Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Model\Totp\TwoFactorInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;

class User implements UserInterface, TwoFactorInterface
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Column(name="totpSecret", type="string", nullable=true)
     */
    private $totpSecret;

    // [...]    

    public function isTotpAuthenticationEnabled(): bool
    {
        return $this->totpSecret ? true : false;
    }

    public function getTotpAuthenticationUsername(): string
    {
        return $this->username;
    }

    public function getTotpAuthenticationConfiguration(): TotpConfigurationInterface
    {
        // You could persist the other configuration options in the user entity to make it individual per user.
        return new TotpConfiguration($this->totpSecret, TotpConfiguration::ALGORITHM_SHA1, 20, 8);
    }
}
```

## Configuration Options

```yaml
scheb_two_factor:
    totp:
        enabled: true                  # If TOTP authentication should be enabled, default false
        server_name: Server Name       # Server name used in QR code
        issuer: Issuer Name            # Issuer name used in QR code
        window: 1                      # How many codes before/after the current one would be accepted as valid
        parameters:                    # Additional parameters added in the QR code
            image: 'https://my-service/img/logo.png'
        template: security/2fa_form.html.twig   # Template used to render the authentication form
```

## Additional parameter

You can set additional parameters, that will be added to the provisioning URI, which is contained in the QR code.
Parameters will be common for all users. Custom parameters may not be supported by all applications, but can be very
interesting to customize the QR codes. In the example below, we add an `image` parameter with the URL to the service's
logo. Some applications, such as FreeOTP, support this parameter and will associate the QR code with that logo.

```yaml
scheb_two_factor:
    totp:
        parameters:
            image: 'https://my-service/img/logo.png'
```

## Custom Authentication Form Template

The bundle uses `Resources/views/Authentication/form.html.twig` to render the authentication form. If you want to use a
different template you can simply register it in configuration:

```yaml
scheb_two_factor:
    totp:
        template: security/2fa_form.html.twig
```

## Generating a Secret Code

The service `scheb_two_factor.security.totp_authenticator` provides a method to generate new secret for TOTP
authentication.

```php
$secret = $container->get("scheb_two_factor.security.totp_authenticator")->generateSecret();
```

With Symfony 4, you can use auto-wiring dependency injection to get the services:

```php
use Scheb\TwoFactorBundle\Security\TwoFactor\Provider\Totp\TotpAuthenticatorInterface;

public function generateSecret(TotpAuthenticatorInterface $totpAuthenticatorService)
{
    $secret = $totpAuthenticatorService->generateSecret();
}
```

## QR Codes

To generate a QR code that can be scanned by the authenticator app, retrieve the QR code's content from TOTP service:

```php
$qrCodeContent = $container->get("scheb_two_factor.security.totp_authenticator")->getQRContent($user);
```

Use a library such as [endroid/qr-code-bundle](https://github.com/endroid/qr-code-bundle) or one of the many JavaScript
libraries to render the QR code image.

**Security note:** Keep the QR code content within your application. Render the image yourself. Do not pass the content
to an external service, because this is exposing the secret code to that service.
